        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a third year psychology major. I go to University of California, Riverside. I am planning on graduating at the end of this school year in June 2023. I currently own my own café shop. I work as a barista, and I also manage the facility myself. My hobbies are crocheting, spending time with cats, and hiking. I also like to cook, and I love making matcha. I believe matcha is an important drink to have at a café because of its health benefits. Matcha can get pricey, but its benefits make up for it in the long run. It is important to invest in high quality matcha, and it is my dream to serve the best matcha with the best benefits at my shop. I started working at many different coffee shops in 2020. I worked at Mundial and Matchaful. I also worked at a smoothie bowl place to learn more about food service. I practice making different types of coffee drinks and espresso-free drinks in my spare time. I have learned a lot about the history behind these drinks as well.<br><br>
